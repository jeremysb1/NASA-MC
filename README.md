# NASA Mission Control Project

I am building this application with React, Hooks, routing with express.js., Node, and MongoDB.

I also use the SpaceX API.

The purpose of this project was to expand my skills with Node and MongoDB.

This application allows users to schedule launch missions, and view upcoming and past missions with NASA and SpaceX.
