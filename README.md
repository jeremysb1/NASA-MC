# NASA Mission Control Project

The purpose of this project was to expand my skills with Node, MongoDB, and the Model-View-Controller software design pattern. This application allows users to schedule launch missions, delete missions, and view upcoming and past missions with NASA and SpaceX. 

I built this application in the following steps:

1.  Built the frontend with React and Hooks
2.  Built the server with Node.js and express.js for routing
3.  Connected the application to MongoDB
4.  Added the SpaceX API 
5.  Built and tested a CI pipeline with Github Actions
6.  Created Docker image

Next steps are:

1. Set up a EC2 instance inside AWS

After I deploy it to the cloud, I will include the link to the application website to this repository.

Below are project images.
