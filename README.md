# NASA Mission Control Project

The purpose of this project was to expand my skills with Node, MongoDB, and the Model-View-Controller software design pattern. This application allows users to schedule launch missions, delete missions, and view upcoming and past missions with NASA and SpaceX. 

I built this application in the following steps:

1.  Built the frontend with React and Hooks
2.  Built the server with Node.js and express.js for routing
3.  Connected the application to MongoDB
4.  Added the SpaceX API 
5.  Built and tested a CI pipeline with Github Actions
6.  Created Docker image
7.  Deployer docker image to an AWS EC2 instance

Below are project images.
