# NASA Mission Control Project

The purpose of this project was to expand my skills with Node and MongoDB. 

I also wanted more practice with the Model-View-Controller software design pattern.

I also used React, Hooks, and express.js for routing, and the SpaceX API.

This application allows users to schedule launch missions, delete missions, and view upcoming and past missions with NASA and SpaceX.
