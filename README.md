# NASA Mission Control Project

The purpose of this project was to expand my skills with Node and MongoDB.

I also built this with React, Hooks, and express.js for routing, and used the SpaceX API.

This application allows users to schedule launch missions, delete missions, and view upcoming and past missions with NASA and SpaceX.
